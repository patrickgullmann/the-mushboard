The Mushboard is a public imageboard platform that allows users to upload images and comment on each.

## Features

### Image Grid

- Photographs are arranged using Grid and Flexbox, with new images appearing at the top.
- Clicking on an image brings up the Image Focus component, where users can see a larger version of the image as well as the image poster's name, the title and description of the image and a comment section.
- Users can leave public visible comments for each image in the comment section.
- Clicking a more at the bottom of the page loads more pictures (until there are no more images).

### Uploader

- On the top of the page, there are inputs for the image data (name, title, and description) plus users can select a file and upload it. 
- Upon completion of upload, the image gets instantaneously added to the image grid and is read to comment.
